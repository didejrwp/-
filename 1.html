<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">This document defines Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)</a>, a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity.</p> <p style= "margin-top:40px;">A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies.</p> In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.

DIDs are URIs that associate a DID subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject. Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or services, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller to prove control of the DID.
